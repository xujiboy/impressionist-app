# impressionist-app
_A deployable `fastai` powered machine learning app to predict the author of an impressionism painting_

## Intro
This is my first trial to use `fastai` ML library (`python`) to train a CNN to predict the author of an impressionist painting, following
the tutorial [notebook](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb) for training and 
this [page](https://course.fast.ai/deployment_google_app_engine.html) for deployment. For the record, the model was trained for 6 classes
(impressionists), namely Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet, and Pierre Auguste Renoir, with 200
painting pictures for each and of which 20% fraction for validation. The output model has an accuracy of ~77%.
